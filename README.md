Repository with instructions for setting up Windows 11 for unattended computing

## Installing Windows 11

To setup Windows 11 without Microsoft account press shift + F10 to spawn a console window. In the consle type:
```OOBE\BYPASSNRO```, the installer will boot into a version that allows skipping over the Microsoft account registration.
This will also allow you to skip the installation of network drivers and connecting to a network.
